# Hypertube

A peer-to-peer movie streaming platform built with Vue.js that leverages the BitTorrent protocol for content delivery.

## Overview

Hypertube is an academic project that demonstrates the implementation of a streaming service using P2P technology. The platform allows streaming of video content while simultaneously downloading it through the BitTorrent protocol, with on-the-fly video conversion using FFmpeg.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue.js
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg for real-time video conversion
- **Content Delivery**: BitTorrent protocol for P2P streaming
- **Video Sources**: YTS API integration

## Key Features

- Real-time video streaming through P2P network
- On-the-fly video format conversion using FFmpeg
- Concurrent downloading and streaming capabilities
- Video quality adaptation based on network conditions

## Project Status

⚠️ **Note**: This project is currently deprecated and not maintained. Due to its age and dependencies on obsolete versions of various libraries, it is no longer suitable for production use or direct deployment.

## Educational Purpose

This project was developed as part of a school curriculum to demonstrate:
- Implementation of P2P protocols
- Video streaming technologies
- Real-time media conversion
- Frontend development with Vue.js

## Legal Notice
